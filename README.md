# Jetpack Compose ConstraintLayout Practice

This project is a hands-on exploration of **ConstraintLayout** in **Jetpack Compose**, demonstrating how to build responsive and flexible UI layouts in modern Android development. The project includes practical implementations such as **Sign In** and **Sign Out** screens that apply a range of ConstraintLayout features.

## 🚀 Key Concepts Covered

✅ **Guidelines**  
Learn how to use horizontal and vertical guidelines to align composables consistently across various screen sizes.

✅ **Chains**  
Implemented horizontal and vertical chains to distribute UI elements with flexible spacing and alignment behavior.

✅ **Barriers**  
Used barriers to create dynamic constraints based on the size or position of other composables.

✅ **Dimensions**  
Applied fixed, wrap content, and match constraints (`Dimension.value`, `Dimension.fillToConstraints`, etc.) to control composable sizing within the layout.

✅ **ConstraintSets**  
Demonstrated how to define reusable constraint sets programmatically for cleaner and more dynamic layout definitions.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Jetpack Compose** – Modern toolkit for building native UI in Android.
- **ConstraintLayout for Compose** – Used for creating complex and responsive UI with ease.

## 💡 What I Learned

- Deep understanding of how to position and size composables using constraints.
- Mastery of various ConstraintLayout tools like Guidelines, Barriers, Chains, and ConstraintSets in Compose.
- Improved ability to build adaptive and scalable UIs in a Compose-based Android project.

## 📌 Why ConstraintLayout in Compose?

While Compose offers simpler layout constructs like `Column`, `Row`, and `Box`, **ConstraintLayout** becomes essential for building **complex UIs** that require precise control over alignment and spacing — especially for scalable screen designs.
